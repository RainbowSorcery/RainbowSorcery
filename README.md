<h2>Abount Me:</h2>
I'm a full-stack developer, but I had to learn Java to make a living. i like to study the underlying computer, but it takes me a long time to learn because of stupidity. talent is really important. I love computer programming and find the computer world really interesting. When I first created a program form file in E, the excitement kept me going. I like to use c/c++ programming language. I am a self-taught and poorly talented developer.Dream one day to make an operating system of their ownï¼Ž
